# TitanicEDA
This project explores the Titanic dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and a simple logistic regression model to predict survival outcomes.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on personal and travel information.
- **Dataset**: Seaborn's built-in `titanic` dataset (derived from the original Kaggle Titanic dataset).
- **Tools Used**:
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Train/Test Split, Classification Metrics)
  - Jupyter Notebook
